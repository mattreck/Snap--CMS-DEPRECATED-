Snap! CMS
=========

At the moment a very simple CMS (Content Management System), that will eventually be very advanced, without all the unwanted problems. Written in PHP, with MySQL databases to handle the storage, it doesn't get more robust and easier to get your website running with this CMS system. It features BootStrap integration, as well as CKEditor for right text editing in your webpages!

Current Features:
- Boostrap Integration (for responsiveness and support in most all browsers)
- Google Font Integration in CKEditor
- Create and Edit pages
- Create seperate admin accounts

Wanted/Upcoming Features:
- Ability to edit multiple content zones (Examples- A sidebar, pages banner, etc)
- A installer/configurer that doesn't require the user to setup all the files at first time use.
- More advanced Administrator Panel, with the ability to edit the database settings right there.
- In the future, remove CKEditor, and move to TinyMCE.
